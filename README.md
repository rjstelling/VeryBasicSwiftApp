# Very Basic Swift App (VBSQ)

## What

An attempt to write a self extracting and building app in Swift.

This creates a mini Mac OS X app that has one window and an functioning Menu Bar. It is built by running a swift script and the app code is extracted from said Swift script. 

I'm not sure how useful it will be but I'm happy to hear any comments or suggestions.

## Build

How to build...
	
```bash
$ chmod 755 build.swift
$ ./build.swift 
```
	
...then double click the vbsa app.
